# Contributing to Reading List

Thanks for your interest in contributing to Reading List :tada::+1:

Contributions are very welcome. Check out the [Readme](https://github.com/AndrewBennet/ReadingList/blob/master/README.md) for requirements and a brief architecture overview. 

A lot of my plans for the app exist only in my head, so if you have a feature idea, please reach out to me first! I may have already started work on it, or it may not align with the planned direction for the project. Feel free to [raise an issue](https://github.com/AndrewBennet/ReadingList/issues), or contact me at feedback@readinglist.app.

Happy Reading :books:
